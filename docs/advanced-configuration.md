You can adjust various development and production settings by setting environment variables in your shell or with [.env](adding-custom-environment-variables.md#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env).

> Note: You do not need to declare `REACT_APP_` before the below variables as you would with custom environment variables.

| Variable             | Development | Production | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| BROWSER              |   âœ… Used   | ðŸš« Ignored | By default, Create React SSR App will open the default system browser, favoring Chrome on macOS. Specify a [browser](https://github.com/sindresorhus/opn#app) to override this behavior, or set it to `none` to disable it completely. If you need to customize the way the browser is launched, you can specify a node script instead. Any arguments passed to `npm start` will also be passed to this script, and the url where your app is served will be the last argument. Your script's file name must have the `.js` extension.              |
| HOST                 |   âœ… Used   | ðŸš« Ignored | By default, the development web server binds to `localhost`. You may use this variable to specify a different host.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| DEV_PORT             |   âœ… Used   | ðŸš« Ignored | By default, the development server will attempt to listen on port 3030 or prompt you to attempt the next available port. You may use this variable to specify a different port.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| PORT                 |   âœ… Used   |  âœ… Used   | By default, the app server will attempt to listen on port 3000 or prompt you to attempt the next available port. You may use this variable to specify a different port.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ASSETS_PATH          | ðŸš« Ignored  |  âœ… Used   | Create React SSR App assumes your application is serving all static assets from the node rendering server. If you with to serve static assets from some other location you can use this env var to specifcy that location so that webpack will inform the app where assets should be fetched from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| CI                   |   âœ… Used   |  âœ… Used   | When set to `true`, Create React SSR App treats warnings as failures in the build. It also makes the test runner non-watching. Most CIs set this flag by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| REACT_EDITOR         |   âœ… Used   | ðŸš« Ignored | When an app crashes in development, you will see an error overlay with clickable stack trace. When you click on it, Create React SSR App will try to determine the editor you are using based on currently running processes, and open the relevant source file. Setting this environment variable overrides the automatic detection. If you do it, make sure your systems [PATH](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>) environment variable points to your editorâ€™s bin folder. You can also set it to `none` to disable it completely. |
| CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING  |   âœ… Used   | ðŸš« Ignored | When set to `true`, the watcher runs in polling mode, as necessary inside a VM. Use this option if `npm start` isn't detecting changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| GENERATE_SOURCEMAP   | ðŸš« Ignored  |  âœ… Used   | When set to `false`, source maps are not generated for a production build. This solves OOM issues on some smaller machines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| NODE_PATH            |   âœ… Used   |  âœ… Used   | Same as [`NODE_PATH` in Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders), but only relative folders are allowed. Can be handy for emulating a monorepo setup by setting `NODE_PATH=src`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK | ðŸš« Ignored  |  âœ… Used   | By default, Create React SSR App will embed the runtime script into `app.html` during the production build. When set to `false`, the script will not be embedded and will be imported as usual. This is normally required when dealing with CSP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
