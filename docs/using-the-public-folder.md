## Changing the HTML

The `public` folder contains the HTML file so you can tweak it, for example, to [set the page title](title-and-meta-tags.md).
The `<script>` tag with the compiled code will be added to it automatically during the build process.

## Adding Assets Outside of the Module System

You can also add other assets to the `public` folder.

Note that we normally encourage you to `import` assets in JavaScript files instead.
For example, see the sections on [adding a stylesheet](adding-a-stylesheet.md) and [adding images and fonts](adding-images-fonts-and-files.md).
This mechanism provides a number of benefits:

- Scripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests.
- Missing files cause compilation errors instead of 404 errors for your users.
- Result filenames include content hashes so you don’t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.

However there is an **escape hatch** that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.

If you put a file into the `public` folder, it will **not** be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched. To reference assets in the `public` folder, you need to use a special variable called `ASSETS_PATH`.

Inside `app.html`, you can use it like this:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="%ASSETS_PATH%/favicon.ico" />
```

Only files inside the `public` folder will be accessible by `%ASSETS_PATH%` prefix. If you need to use a file from `src` or `node_modules`, you’ll have to copy it there to explicitly specify your intention to make this file a part of the build.

When you run `npm run build`, Create React SSR App will substitute `%ASSETS_PATH%` with a correct absolute path so your project works.

In JavaScript code, you can use `process.env.ASSETS_PATH` for similar purposes:

```js
render() {
  // Note: this is an escape hatch and should be used sparingly!
  // Normally we recommend using `import` for getting asset URLs
  // as described in “Adding Images and Fonts” above this section.
  return <img src={process.env.ASSETS_PATH + '/img/logo.png'} />;
}
```

Keep in mind the downsides of this approach:

- None of the files in `public` folder get post-processed or minified.
- Missing files will not be called at compilation time, and will cause 404 errors for your users.
- Result filenames won’t include content hashes so you’ll need to add query arguments or rename them every time they change.

## When to Use the `public` Folder

Normally we recommend importing [stylesheets](adding-a-stylesheet.md), [images, and fonts](adding-images-fonts-and-files.md) from JavaScript.
The `public` folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases:

- You need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as [`manifest.webmanifest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).
- You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.
- You want to include a small script like [`pace.js`](https://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/) outside of the bundled code.
- Some library may be incompatible with Webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a `<script>` tag.

Note that if you add a `<script>` that declares global variables, you also need to read the next section on using them.

## Running in production

When the app is built for production, all contents of the public folder as well as all static assets generated by webpack (js, css, images, etc) will be copied into the `build` directory. By default when the node server runs it will serve all static assets (public folder contents and webpack generated contents). This will work just fine by default but it is recommended to store static assets in a CDN for faster delivery. By doing this you relieve the node server from having to serve static assets which will improve production performence since the node server will only have to handle serving html content. If you choose to store static assets on a CDN you will need to inform webpack during the build process using the `ASSETS_PATH` env var (e.g. `process.env.ASSETS_PATH = https://cdn.myapp.com/`). You will also need to be sure to upload the `public` folder contents inside the `build` directory to the CDN location after building. More information can be found [here](deployment.md).
