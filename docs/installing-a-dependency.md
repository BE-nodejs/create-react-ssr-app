title: Installing a Dependency

The generated project includes Exress, React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React SSR App as a dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:

```sh
npm install --save react-router-dom
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add react-router-dom
```

This works for any library, not just `react-router-dom`.
